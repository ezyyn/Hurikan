# Hurikan
#### HurikanEngine is an experimental Game Engine created by me. 
#### Currently supporting only Windows and OpenGL
## How to build
#### 1. You need to have python installed
#### 2. Go to folder *scripts/*
#### 3. Launch *Setup.bat* (if it does not recognize command "py", edit this file and change for "python")
#### 4. The script will install everything and ultimately fail.
#### 5. That is okay, close the window and launch *AudioStuff.bat*
#### 6. This will install additional libraries
#### 7. And lastly launch *Win-GenProjects.bat*, that will build the solution
#### 8. Premake generated solution file for VS2019/VS2022 in the root folder
#### 9. Project Sandbox represents bomberman game.
