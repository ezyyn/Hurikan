# Hurikan
#### HurikanEngine is an experimental Game Engine created by me. 
#### Currently supporting only Windows and OpenGL
## How to build
#### You need to have python installed
#### Go to folder *scripts/*
#### Launch *Setup.bat* (if it does not recognize command "py", edit this file and change for "python"
#### The script will install everything and ultimately fail.
#### That is okay, close the window and launch *AudioStuff.bat*
#### This will install additional libraries
#### And lastly launch *Win-GenProjects.bat*, that will build the solution
#### Premake generated solution file for VS2019/VS2022 in the root folder
#### Project Sandbox represents bomberman game.
